    description: Updated GET /api/v1/artists endpoint to include albums relation using Ent's WithAlbums() method
errors: []
notes: |
  Successfully updated the GET /api/v1/artists endpoint to include associated albums in the response.

  Changes made:
  - Added WithAlbums() to the Artist query to eager load the albums relation
  - Updated function comment to reflect that albums are now included

  The endpoint now returns artists with their albums nested in the response. Each artist object will include an "albums" array containing all associated albums.

  Example response structure:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "name": "Artist Name",
      "created_at": "2025-01-27T00:00:00Z",
      "albums": [
        {
          "id": "uuid",
          "title": "Album Title",
          "artist_id": "uuid",
          "created_at": "2025-01-27T00:00:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```
