    description: Created Artist entity schema with id (UUID), name (string, max_length 255), and created_at (datetime) fields
errors: []
notes: |
  After applying this intent, you need to regenerate Ent code:
  
  ```bash
  cd api
  go generate ./ent
  ```
  
  This will regenerate all Ent client code including the new Artist entity.
  After regeneration, run migrations to update the database schema:
  
  The Artist entity includes:
  - id: UUID field with Default(uuid.New) and Unique() constraint
  - name: String field with MaxLen(255), required (no Optional())
  - created_at: Time field with Default(time.Now)
  
  The database table "artists" will be created when migrations are run.
